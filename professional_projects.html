        <h3>Magna instrument Firmware development (2020-2023) - Depixus </h3>
        <p> Depixus is a biotech company developing a new technology (MAGNA) for extracting exhaustive
          information from DNA/RNA fragments. This technology needs a unique instrument to support it, which is
          developed in parallel to the technology by Depixus.
          I personally contibuted to the development of the instrument by leading the development of the firmware, which
          is the microprogram running on the unique microcontroller of the instrument which pilotes its physical functions.
          I started the project alone in 2020 and was later joined by two other firmware engineers.
          Together and in cooperation with the other teams developing the instrument (Mechanical, Electronics, R&D,..), we
          developed the firmware that would run on the Beta release of the instrument.</p>

          In this project I have:
          <ul>
            <li>Chosen the microcontroller model and contributed to its integration on a PCB</li>
            <li>Implemented an architecture based on the Active Objects pattern using the QPCPP framework suite</li>
            <li>Developed drivers and middlewares in C and C++ for controlling IMU, Motors driver (Stepper, DC), position sensor, ext. ADC, RH sensor, EEPROMs,
            screen controller, laser controller, TÂ° sensor.
            </li>
            <li>Developed numerous unit and integration tests for the active objects, drivers, and middlewares </li>
            <li>Created docker images and CI pipelines on gitlab for running unit tests on the cloud and integration test on dedicated testbenches</li>
            <li>Implemented Scrum and Devops methodology principles in a team of 3 engineers (including me) </li>
          </ul>
