        <h3>&#8226 Magna instrument Firmware development (2020-2023) - Depixus </h3>
        <p> Depixus is a biotech company developing a new technology (MAGNA) for extracting advcanced
          information from DNA/RNA fragments. Because the technology is unique, it needed a specific instrument to support it. 
          I personally contibuted to the development of the instrument by leading the development of its unique microcontroller's 
          firmware, which pilots most of the instrument physical functions.
          I started the project in early 2021 and was later joined in early 2022 by two other junior engineers who came under my responsability.
          Together, and in strong cooperation with the other teams developing the instrument (Mechanical, Electronics, R&D,..), we developed a robust firmware 
          that is now deployed on the Beta release of the instrument.</p>

          In this project I have:
          <ul>
            <li>Chosen the microcontroller model and contributed to its integration on a PCB</li>
            <li>Implemented an architecture based on the Active Objects pattern using the QPCPP framework suite</li>
            <li>Developed drivers and middlewares in C and C++ for controlling IMU, Motors driver (Stepper, DC), position sensor, ext. ADC, RH sensor, EEPROMs,
            screen controller, laser controller, TÂ° sensor.
            </li>
            <li>Developed numerous unit and integration tests for the active objects, drivers, and middlewares </li>
            <li>Created docker images and CI pipelines on gitlab for running unit tests on the cloud and integration test on dedicated testbenches</li>
            <li>Implemented Scrum and Devops methodology principles in a team of 3 engineers (including me). In this regard, I acted as a product owner and developer. </li>
          </ul>
