          <h3>&#8226 Magna instrument Firmware development (2020-2023) - Depixus, Paris </h3>
          <p>Depixus is a biotech company developing a new technology (MAGNA) for extracting advanced information from
            DNA/RNA fragments. Because the technology is unique, the company developed in-house a specific instrument to
            support it.</p>

          <p>I contributed to this project by having the responsibility of developing the instrument firmware, which
            pilots most of its physical functions. Initially, I spearheaded the project independently, and later, two
            junior engineers joined the team under my supervision.
            Through collaborative efforts with other departments such as Mechanical, Electronics, and R&D, we
            successfully engineered a robust firmware that is now deployed on the Beta release of the instrument.</p>

          <p>Throughout the project, my responsibilities included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Selecting the appropriate microcontroller model and contributing to its integration onto a printed
              circuit
              board (PCB).</li>
            <li>Designing and implementing an architecture based on the Active Objects pattern using the QPCPP framework
              suite</li>
            <li>Developing drivers and middleware in C and C++ for various components including IMU, Motors driver
              (Stepper, DC), position sensor, external ADC, RH sensor, EEPROMs, screen controller, laser controller, and
              temperature sensor.</li>
            <li>Developing numerous unit and integration tests for the active objects, drivers, and middlewares</li>
            <li>Creating docker images and CI pipelines on GitLab for running unit tests on the cloud and integration
              test
              on dedicated testbenches</li>
            <li>Implementing Scrum and DevOps methodologies within our team of three engineers, where I took on the
              roles
              of both product owner and developer.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>&#8226 Teacher (January 2022 - April 2022) - ECE engineering school, Paris </h3>
          <p>
            I have instructed courses within the "Prototyping platform" module, designed to familiarize students with
            embedded systems development. I played a significant role in the preparation of the course of the module,
            which comprised one-fourth of theoretical lectures and the remainder in
            practical sessions. Students learned how to develop embedded IOT applications on an ESP32-C3 microcontroller
            through excercises combining communication with the AWS cloud and interaction with the peripherals connected
            to the microcontrollers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, exercises were conducted using Arduino, while later exercices were conducted with ESP-IDF, a
            framework better suited for industrial applications and offering closer interactions with hardware.
