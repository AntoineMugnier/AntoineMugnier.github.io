        <h3>&#8226 Magna instrument Firmware development (2020-2023) - Depixus </h3>
        <p>Depixus is a biotech company developing a new technology (MAGNA) for extracting advanced information from
          DNA/RNA fragments. Because the technology is unique, the company developed in-house a specific instrument to
          support it.</p>

        <p>I contributed to this project by having the responsibility of developing the instrument firmware, which
          pilots most of its physical functions. Initially, I spearheaded the project independently, and later, two junior engineers joined the team under my supervision.
          Through collaborative efforts with other departments such as Mechanical, Electronics, and R&D, we successfully engineered a robust firmware that is now deployed on the Beta release of the instrument.</p>

        <p>Throughout the project, my responsibilities included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Selecting the appropriate microcontroller model and contributing to its integration onto a printed circuit
            board (PCB).</li>
          <li>Designing and implementing an architecture based on the Active Objects pattern using the QPCPP framework
            suite</li>
          <li>Developing drivers and middleware in C and C++ for various components including IMU, Motors driver
            (Stepper, DC), position sensor, external ADC, RH sensor, EEPROMs, screen controller, laser controller, and
            temperature sensor.</li>
          <li>Developing numerous unit and integration tests for the active objects, drivers, and middlewares</li>
          <li>Creating docker images and CI pipelines on GitLab for running unit tests on the cloud and integration test
            on dedicated testbenches</li>
          <li>Implementing Scrum and DevOps methodologies within our team of three engineers, where I took on the roles
            of both product owner and developer.</li>
        </ul>
