          <h3>Kaori-HSM, an event-driven Hierarchical State Machine(HSM) library in Rust (Released in 2024-)</h3>
          <p>
            The QPCPP framework I used at Depixus included a library called <a class=hyperlink target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/qpcpp/api.html">QEP</a> 
            which allows to develop hierarchical state machines in C++. Hierarchical state machines are different from regular state machine
            in the way they can have nested states, allowing multiple states to share the same handling of events thanks to their common states.
            This trait of HSMs prevents a lot of repetitive code that would be present in non-hierarchical state machines equivalent.
            </p>
            <p>
            I strongly believe in the potential of HSMs and in particular in Active Objects based architecture in the embedded world.
            I also strongly believe that Rust is a promising language to be used in embedded systems development.
            That's why I develop my own QEP equivalent in Rust that I called Kaori-HSM. Kaori-HSM is however far from being a copy of QEP.
            It takes advantage of Rust-specific features like traits and macros to give to the user what I judge a better API. Kaori-HSM can also have an
            infinite degree of nested states thanks to a recursive states searching algorithm, while QEP is limited to 6.
            </p>
            <p>
            I hope in a close future to be able to add more crates working in synergy with Kaori-HSM, I'm thinking of a tool generating statechart diagrams
            from Kaori-HSM state machine code, a crate for performing unit test on Kaori-HSM and maybe also of a crate for checking the state machine respects
            UML 2.5 standard. We will see...
